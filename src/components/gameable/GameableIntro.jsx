      <p>Imagine a person who loves gaming got out from work late and got to his or her home, tired. Got shower, ate dinner and turned on the computer wanting to play his or her favorite online game, but none of his/her friends were online at the time so therefore he/she solo queued for a match and got matched up with totally random people who he/she does not know anything about them and could not connect with therefore had arguments during the game, people started getting frustrated with the non-connection that they had, had fights, people yelled at each other for each other’s mistakes and everyone got frustrated. The match on the other hand ended in a loss. </p>
      <p>Nowadays, most of the online multiplayer games are team-based games where everyone depends on each other’s skillsets and communication which is hard when the gamers must spend effort in order to find a connection with total random strangers whom they know nothing about their personality, skillset or equipment (if they have a microphone or not, or if they have good internet that they are playing lag-free). And on the other hand, these gamers will also have to focus on their performance so that they can perform well and contribute to a team victory so that they can progress forward in the game. </p>
      <p>Most of the video games require 4 total teammates (5 including the gamer itself) (NOTE: number of teammates may vary depending on the game), which can be hard to always maintain, schedules might not match, one of the friends might stop playing the game, etc. Gameable offers a solution where gamers can find other gamers to play with when their friends are offline so that they would not get frustrated and lose games due to that. Gameable aims to achieve more competitive games between the gamers where each gamer enjoys the game they play and only focuses on performing better and improving their game instead of worrying about how the next random person will be like or if they will be able to connect with the next random person they match up with. With the “real-time” match up system, users will be able to find their next gaming friend within matter of minutes. </p>
